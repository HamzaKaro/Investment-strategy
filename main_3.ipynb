    "Votre espion qui évolue au sein de Crystal Dawn et qui a miraculeusement échappé à l'épidémie a réussi à vous obtenir un entretien vendredi prochain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Il vous fournit les exigeances de la compagnie qui doivent impérativement être respectées sans quoi vous n'aurez aucune chance de décrocher le contrat:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Le portefeuille doit être **long-only** et toujours comporter au moins 120 titres - $\\sum (w_i\\geq.0000001) \\geq 120$.\n",
    "- Vous ne pouvez investir que dans les 304 titres représentatifs du S&P 500 fournis avec le présent notebook.\n",
    "- La stratégie doit être 'aveugle', il est interdit d'utiliser de l'information implicite liée au futur lorsque vous roulez votre stratégie sur les données historiques. (Vous risquez d'attraper le *Luckehead Byus*.)\n",
    "- Vous pouvez rebalancer votre portefeuille chaque jour.\n",
    "\n",
    "La compagnie à qui vous essayez de vendre votre stratégie va tenir des mini conférences le samedi matin ainsi que le dimanche. Assurez-vous d'y être pour récolter des informations supplémentaires sur ce à quoi elle sera attentive lors de votre présentation.\n",
